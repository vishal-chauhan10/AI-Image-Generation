# Business Logic for Game

## 1. Game Mechanics
- **Image Generation**: Use the Gemini API to generate images based on user prompts or game scenarios. For example, players could input a description, and the game generates a corresponding image.
- **Scoring System**: Implement a scoring system based on how closely the generated images match the target images. Use the Cloud Vision API to analyze and compare images, calculating similarity scores.

## 2. User Interaction
- **Feedback Loop**: Provide users with feedback based on their inputs and the generated images. For example, if the generated image is very similar to the target, you could give a high score and positive feedback.
- **Hints and Suggestions**: If a player's generated image is far from the target, you could offer hints or suggestions for improving their prompts.

## 3. Progression and Levels
- **Level Design**: Create different levels or challenges where players must generate images based on increasingly complex prompts or themes.
- **Unlockable Content**: Implement a system where players can unlock new prompts, themes, or features as they progress through the game.

## 4. User Accounts and High Scores
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to create accounts to save their progress, scores, and generated images.
- **High Score Leaderboard**: Maintain a leaderboard that displays the top scores, encouraging competition among players.

## 5. Monetization Strategies
- **In-App Purchases**: Consider offering premium features, such as additional image generation credits, exclusive prompts, or customization options for generated images.
- **Advertisements**: If appropriate, you could integrate ads into the game to generate revenue.

## 6. Analytics and User Engagement
- **Track User Behavior**: Use analytics to track how users interact with the game, which prompts are most popular, and where users tend to drop off.
- **Engagement Strategies**: Implement push notifications or email campaigns to re-engage users, informing them of new features or challenges.

## 7. Community Features
- **Sharing and Collaboration**: Allow users to share their generated images on social media or within the game community. You could also implement collaborative challenges where users work together to achieve a common goal.

## Example Business Logic Implementation
Here's a simplified example of how you might structure some of this logic in your game:

```typescript
// Function to handle image generation and scoring
export const handleImageGeneration = async (userPrompt: string): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    // Generate an image based on user input
    const generatedImage = await generateImage(userPrompt);
    
    // Compare the generated image with a target image
    const targetImage = getTargetImageForCurrentLevel(); // Fetch the target image for the current level
    const score = await calculateScore(targetImage, generatedImage);
    
    // Provide feedback based on the score
    const feedback = generateFeedback(score);
    
    // Save the score and update user profile
    saveHighScore(score);
    
    // Display the generated image and feedback to the user
    displayImageAndFeedback(generatedImage, feedback);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in image generation process:', error);
  }
};
```
